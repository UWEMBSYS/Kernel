# Kernel
A rudimentry multi-threading kernel, scheduler example

This is meant as an educational tool with branches related to the the exercises throughout the semester.
It will be used to demonstrate multi threaded programming of an embedded system, eventually to utilize the Bluetooth addon board (x-nucleo-1db04a1) for a Nucleo Stm32f401RE development board.

The toolchain is IAR, this was a airly arbiratry choice as it represents an IDE typical for embedded development, this could easily have been Keil or Cypress PSoC Creator if a PSoC was chosen, or eclipse etc....

The tests are Unit Test examples used to describe the API and how it is intended to be used - in the spirit of Test Driver Design.
